# Introduction

OtaKu is a group of 4 Computer Science students from the University of Johannesburg , Adonis Kahila, Mpho Dinala, Vikas Nwandule and Kenwood Nyirenda who have decided to create a task tracking system that will be used in a school environment. This system will track the progress of the schools learners and their marks too. The system will then send progress reports to the parents of the learners, and the learners can also view their progress reports on the system.


# Background

The  institution  that  we  will  be  building  a  system  for  is  a  high  school  in  central Johannesburg  called  Barnato  Park  High  School  ,  it  was  established  in  1990  by Fanny Buckland.  The  school  currently  has  roughly  about  950  students registered  to  it,  with  an  average  class  of  45  and  is  a  English  Hl  school  with diversity  of  learners  from  all  round  Johannesburg. The schools current principal is Mervin Frank and the school has 32 teaching stuff currently.

# Problem Statement

The  problem  that  Barnato  Park  High  School  is  currently  facing  now  is  caused mostly  by  the  problem  that  the  world  is  facing  right  now,  Covid  19.  Due  to  the nation  lockdown  the  school  and  learners  have  to  receive  their  and  do  their work  remotely  from  home  .  The  system  that  is  currently  used  is  to  send  the work  to  the  learners  through  Whatsapp  groups  ,from  which  the  learners  then have  to  work  on  it  and  read  the  notes  and  try  to  make  sense  of  it  on  their  own. Even  asking  the  teachers  question  cause  they  don’t  know  what  to  ask  cause they  don’t  know  what  they  reading.  This  system  has  cut  down  the  amount  of face  time  between  learners  and  teachers  disruptively.  This  has  lead  to  a detrimental  decline  in  the  progress  and  marks  of  the  students.  This  means  that the  students  are  not  understanding  the  work  ,  assignments,  projects  and  might be  falling  behind  with  the  course  content.  The system we are building will track the students progress and work and this will allow the teachers to be able to assist any student that might be bit behind with work to catch up and get better marks and understand the work much better.

# Possible Solution

The  solution  that  we  are  coming  with  is  to  develop  a  system  website  that  will allow  thorough  communication  between  students  and  teachers.  The  system will  allow  the  teachers  to  track  the  weekly  progress of the student. The  system  will  send  out  weekly  updates  to  the  parents  directly  and  the parents  will  only  be  able  to  view and the students will also be able to view their own weekly updates and progress reports.
