# Problem Statement

The current pandemic climate is forcing Barnato Park High students to conduct their work assignments remotely. Pre-pandemic methods of course work distribution were easily done during contact lessons; however, the method has since been replaced with teachers assigning work assignments to their classes via Whatsapp group posts. 

The WhatsApp group posts do not efficiently facilitate communication between teacher and student during work assignments because there is no functionality for managing the workflow of students doing assignments and teachers giving feedback. So, some students may work on assignments without guidance or understanding from the teacher.

Work progress towards course content is slowed because teachers and students do not always meet for contact lessons. The progress of the students towards course content, assignments, and projects is not easily measured and thus teachers cannot monitor students individually and gauge class understanding of a topic, this could lead to the students' knowledge of the course not growing consistently. 

# Proposed Solution

The system to be built will track
the students progress and work and will allow the teachers to
assist and monitor any student's progress.

The solution to the highlighted problems: is a system that allows efficient and thorough communication/feedback between teacher and student on work content (assignments, projects, homework). Each work assignment can have suggested commentary or important feedback about a student's understanding of an assignment from the class teacher.

The system provides functionality for a teacher to define their assignments, project requirements and homework tasks by using an interface that creates questions and has predefined answers (given by the teacher) that students would need to complete. Each answered question will be kept track of and used during report generation; this will assist teachers in tracking the progress of each student's effort towards the work as each answered task adds towards that task's completion. This functionality will serve to create binary type questions; meaning it will allow the creation of questions that have a single answer to them (multiple-choice, true or false, etc.). This is to avoid students being auto marked unfairly for entering values that may be right in the context of the task but do not match with the exact value(s) in the assignment answer database. PDF type assignments will be a way teachers can create non-binary assignments by uploading a PDF document and entering student marks manually.

A progress report or report card is sent to the parents of the students for viewing and each student can also view their efforts towards the completion of a task and completed tasks with feedback from the teacher. Students will be able to view a statistical report of their efforts in a subject and teachers can view a aggregate statistical report of the class' efforts and individual students.
